# ðŸ’€ Guess who? It's the _Reapo_ Man! ðŸ’€

Time for your dayjob down at the Reapo Depot, where you'll be harvesting the souls of the nearly departed.

Use your charge-up scythe to reap souls in this action-puzzler - but be sure to harvest the souls from your Heaven or Hell quota before the time runs out!

Avoid obstacles in your scythe's path and gain power-ups to extend your reap-range.

At the end of the week, retire to your afterlife of leisure!

Enjoy original art, music, and color commentary from Lando Systems.
